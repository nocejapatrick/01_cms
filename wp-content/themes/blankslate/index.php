                            This easy Pad Thai Noodles with Prawns and Tofu dish is simple to make you can skip eating out and make this at home.

HOW TO MAKE IT:
1. Start with soaking the dry noodles in room temperature water for 20 minutes while prepping the other ingredients. The dry noodles should be fully submerged in water. You want the noodles to be pliable and firm, but not completely expanded and soft. Drain and set the noodles aside.

2. Heat the oil in a wok (or a large pot) over medium-high heat. Stir fry the tofu and shallots until fragrant and beginning to color. Add the prawns and stir fry for 2 minutes, until just cooked. Add the rice noodles, tamarind concentrate (or white vinegar, if using), sugar, fish sauce and dried shrimp (if using), stirring to combine. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water a little at a time if the noodle mixture is sticky.

3. Push the noodle mixture to one side of the pan and add the lightly beaten eggs to the wok. Allow the eggs to cook for about 1 minute before mixing everything together. Stir in the Chinese chives and bean sprouts for a few seconds before removing the wok from the heat.

4. Serve the Pad Thai immediately and garnish with crushed peanuts and lime wedges.

INGREDIENTS:
4 tablespoons avocado oil (you can use olive oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil)
1 package (12 oz.) extra firm tofu, cute into 1/2 inch x 2 inches strips
4 shallots, thinly sliced
1 pound raw prawns, shelled and deveined
8 ounces dried flat rice noodl
4 tablespoons tamarind concentrate
4 tablespoons coconut sugar (also called palm sugar)
3 tablespoons fish sauce (we used Red Boat brand)
1 tablespoon dried shrimp (optional)
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup Chinese chives, cut in 2 inches (optional)
Large handful bean sprouts
4 tablespoons crushed roasted and unsalted peanuts
1 lime, cut into wedges

                            This Thai recipe for stir-fried crab in curry sauce, Boo Paht Pong Karee, is unique in Thai cuisine, as it is prepared with dry curry powder and sometimes fresh milk. Normally, Thai curries are prepared with a curry paste of fresh spices and coconut milk. Almost every recipe for this classic Thai dish adds oyster sauce, nam prik pao, white pepper, egg, fresh chilies and Chinese celery.

HOW TO MAKE IT:
1. Clean the crab by removing the shell and chopping into pieces; crack the claws and legs by hitting with the blunt edge of a heavy cleaver.
2. In a wok, heat vegetable oil over a low heat. When hot, fry garlic until aromatic and golden. Add the crab and stir fry for 3-5 minutes or until cooked through. Mix seasoning sauce ingredients with chicken stock. Add to the wok and bring to a boil, stirring. Boil for 3-5 minutes.
3. Add egg to the wok and stir well until cooked. Add milk, tapioca flour, Chinese celery, red chili. Stir well until cooked. Spoon onto a serving plate.

INGREDIENTS:
1 large Dungess crab
1 fresh red mildly spicy chili, diagonal sliced
2 stalks of Chinese celery, sliced 1 inch length
1 egg
1 Tablespoon chopped garlic
2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
1 Tablespoon tapioca flour, dissolved in a small amount of water
2 Tablespoon milk or coconut milk
1/2 cup chicken stock
Vegetable oil for stir-fried

SEASONING SAUCE INGREDIENTS:
1 teaspoon Maggi seasoning sauce
1 Tablespoon Thai light soy sauce
2 teaspoons oyster sauce
1 Tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 1/2 Teaspoons roasted chili paste (nam prik pao)

                            Tom Yum Goong (ต้มยำกุ้ง) soup is one of the most well known dishes in Thai cuisine, and in this recipes you'll learn to make the authentic Thai street food style version. There are 2 different types of tom yum, the clear version and the creamy version, and there's directions on how to make both types. Enjoy this recipe for tom yum.

                            HOW TO MAKE IT:
                            1. First thing to do is put about 2 liters of water in a pot to boil.
                            2. Then I like to start by squeezing my limes. This is not the first step of the recipe, but it’s best to have your limes squeezed so when you need them later, you don’t need to rush to squeeze them all. Slice about 10 limes and juice them all into a small bowl, and set them aside for later.
                            3. Take your stalks of lemongrass, and first tear off the outermost leaf and throw it out. Then, I like to use a mallet to lightly pound the lemongrass to release the flavors. Then just slice it diagonally into 1 inch strips or so.
                            4. Take about 1 thumb sized chunk of the root part of galangal, and chop it into slices.
                            5. Coarsely break about 10 kaffir lime leaves - no need to cut them, just tear them - which is going to help release their flavor.
                            6. Peel about 5 cloves of garlic.
                            7. I used about 10 Thai bird chilies (prik kee noo) for this recipe, but you can use however many you’d like. First, take off the stem, and then you can either just slice them in two pieces, or give them a little pound on your cutting board like I did (just be careful of flying seeds). You can also remove the seeds if you’d still like the chili flavor but not as much heat.
                            8. Throw the lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, garlic and chilies into the water. You can put on the lid just so it starts to boil and release all the herb flavors quicker.
                            9. Now prepare your shrimp (or whatever meat of choice you’re making tom yum with). Since I used goong mae nam (กุ้งแม่น้ำ), freshwater shrimp, I first chopped off all the tentacles.
                            10. Boil your soup with all the herbs in it for about 10 minutes, and you can go ahead and toss in the shrimp and turn the fire to low.
                            11. Then add your mushrooms, which you should pre rinse beforehand.
                            12. Take two roma tomatoes and two small white onions and slice them into wedges - you want them to be big and chunky. Then go ahead and add them to the tom yum.
                            13. If you’re using shrimp for this tom yum recipe, you might get some foam build up on top of your soup, in which case you can just lightly skim it off the top and toss it out.
                            14. Boil the tom yum for about 2 - 3 minutes.
                            15. Next, add about 6 tablespoons of fish sauce first, and 2 teaspoons of sugar. You may need more of each, but start with that.
                            16. Boil your tom yum for another minute or so and then turn off the heat. You don’t want your tom yum to be overcooked. The mushrooms and onions should be soft, and then it’s ready.
                            17. Once your heat is off, go back to your lime juice and add about 8 tablespoons of lime juice (depending on how sour you like it, I like it really sour).
                            18. Make sure you taste test until your tom yum is perfectly sour and salty. You might need to add more fish sauce, sugar, or lime juice.
                            19. Finally chop up a handful of fresh cilantro, throw it in the soup, and give your tom yum a final stir. The lime juice and cilantro taste fresher and more vibrant when not boiled, so that’s why I turn off the heat before adding them.
                            20. You now have Tom yum goong nam sai (ต้มยำกุ้งน้ำใส), the clear version of tom yum.

                            INGREDIENTS:
                            2 liters of water
                            4 stalks of lemongrass
                            1 inch chunk of galangal
                            10 kaffir lime leaves
                            10 Thai chilies
                            5 cloves of garlic
                            1/2 kilo shrimp
                            300 grams of oyster mushrooms
                            2 roma tomatoes
                            2 white onions (medium sized)
                            2 teaspoons of sugar
                            8 - 12 tablespoons of fish sauce (depending on your taste)
                            8 - 12 tablespoons of lime juice (10 - 15 limes)

                            Curry is a staple dish of Thailand introduced by Indian immigrants over the past several hundred years. It is affordable and considered a healthy part of the Thai diet. High in vitamins and rich in protein, it is easily digested when eaten spooned over steamed jasmine rice or kanom jeen (round rice noodles).

An interesting tidbit is that green curry is the only type of Thai curry paste made with fresh Thai chilies. All other types of curry paste are made up of dried Thai chilies. The addition of coconut milk gently mellows the heat of the fresh Thai chilies without compromising their flavorful contribution to the dish.

This classic Thai dish shot to the top of list of potential candidates to pair with our wine of the month pick as part of our monthly wine pairing challenge.  The 2013 French Viognier, produced out of the Costières de Nîmes in the Rhone Valley’s most southern vineyard by Michel Gassier, paired amazingly well.

Prior to cooking, soften the diced eggplant by gently tossing with sea salt in a colander, leave for 10 minutes, then rinse off. This will result in a delicately textured eggplant that melts in your mouth.

                            Goong Chae Nam Pla is a dish of extremely fresh uncooked prawns bathed in a spicy, sour, and salty sauce with just a hint of sweetness from palm sugar. The prawns are typically arranged beautifully on a bed of sliced cabbage and cucumbers.

The Thais often wash their marinated raw prawns down with some cold beers, such as Leo or Chang.  The Nam Pla in the title refers to the dish’s generous use of fish sauce. 

Goong Chae Nam Pla is typically chilled for about 15 minutes prior to serving, which preserves the freshness and gives the shrimp more flavor. The best way I can describe the taste of soft raw shrimp is buttery and slightly sweet; it genuinely tastes surprisingly good.

The addition of copious amounts of garlic, chili, lime juice, and fish sauce ensures a zingy fresh flavor that complements the soft buttery shrimp perfectly. Crunchy vegetables add texture and bite to the dish. 

Goong Chae Nam Pla definitely falls under the category of weird Thai food dishes that taste great. But only order it if you can become comfortable with the notion of raw prawns.

                            Tom Yum Goong (ต้มยำกุ้ง) soup is one of the most well known dishes in Thai cuisine, and in this recipes you'll learn to make the authentic Thai street food style version. There are 2 different types of tom yum, the clear version and the creamy version, and there's directions on how to make both types. Enjoy this recipe for tom yum.

                            HOW TO MAKE IT:
                            1. First thing to do is put about 2 liters of water in a pot to boil.
                            2. Then I like to start by squeezing my limes. This is not the first step of the recipe, but it’s best to have your limes squeezed so when you need them later, you don’t need to rush to squeeze them all. Slice about 10 limes and juice them all into a small bowl, and set them aside for later.
                            3. Take your stalks of lemongrass, and first tear off the outermost leaf and throw it out. Then, I like to use a mallet to lightly pound the lemongrass to release the flavors. Then just slice it diagonally into 1 inch strips or so.
                            4. Take about 1 thumb sized chunk of the root part of galangal, and chop it into slices.
                            5. Coarsely break about 10 kaffir lime leaves - no need to cut them, just tear them - which is going to help release their flavor.
                            6. Peel about 5 cloves of garlic.
                            7. I used about 10 Thai bird chilies (prik kee noo) for this recipe, but you can use however many you’d like. First, take off the stem, and then you can either just slice them in two pieces, or give them a little pound on your cutting board like I did (just be careful of flying seeds). You can also remove the seeds if you’d still like the chili flavor but not as much heat.
                            8. Throw the lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, garlic and chilies into the water. You can put on the lid just so it starts to boil and release all the herb flavors quicker.
                            9. Now prepare your shrimp (or whatever meat of choice you’re making tom yum with). Since I used goong mae nam (กุ้งแม่น้ำ), freshwater shrimp, I first chopped off all the tentacles.
                            10. Boil your soup with all the herbs in it for about 10 minutes, and you can go ahead and toss in the shrimp and turn the fire to low.
                            11. Then add your mushrooms, which you should pre rinse beforehand.
                            12. Take two roma tomatoes and two small white onions and slice them into wedges - you want them to be big and chunky. Then go ahead and add them to the tom yum.
                            13. If you’re using shrimp for this tom yum recipe, you might get some foam build up on top of your soup, in which case you can just lightly skim it off the top and toss it out.
                            14. Boil the tom yum for about 2 - 3 minutes.
                            15. Next, add about 6 tablespoons of fish sauce first, and 2 teaspoons of sugar. You may need more of each, but start with that.
                            16. Boil your tom yum for another minute or so and then turn off the heat. You don’t want your tom yum to be overcooked. The mushrooms and onions should be soft, and then it’s ready.
                            17. Once your heat is off, go back to your lime juice and add about 8 tablespoons of lime juice (depending on how sour you like it, I like it really sour).
                            18. Make sure you taste test until your tom yum is perfectly sour and salty. You might need to add more fish sauce, sugar, or lime juice.
                            19. Finally chop up a handful of fresh cilantro, throw it in the soup, and give your tom yum a final stir. The lime juice and cilantro taste fresher and more vibrant when not boiled, so that’s why I turn off the heat before adding them.
                            20. You now have Tom yum goong nam sai (ต้มยำกุ้งน้ำใส), the clear version of tom yum.
